# JS Projects

This project is a playground for me ultimately. I am going to be playing with building out custom monorepo tooling in the Bun ecosystem. I think Bun has huge potential as a great monorepo tool as it integrates so many disparate parts of the node ecosystem. Namely native TS support, the build in test runner, and the ESM first design. I think Bun has the potentially to eventually overtake node strictly due to its developer friendliness. 

## Current projects in monorepo

**authentication**: A simple express JWT authentication server. I wanted to learn more about what an auth server actually does so i worked through a simple implementation. My plan is to continue developing it over time until its something i think i can user in other projects. 

**a-modern-proposal**: a gag astro site i want to eventually make that is a modern take on the essay "A Modest Proposal" its literally just a default astro template as im still workshopping the concept.

**three-fiber-site**: a playground for a 3D game built with react-three-fiber. I hope to make it into an actual playable example at some point.


For now the main focus is building out some more tooling around the monorepo. Its nice to have some sample apps in here for testing. I hope to continue working on both the projects and the monorepo tooling but its a lot honestly.
