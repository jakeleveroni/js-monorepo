# Serverless Backend Playground

This is a project for playing around with Fermyon spin. Its a wasm runtime serverless backend technology. 

I was interested in learning more about serveless backends when i found Fermyon spin. I had heard of WASM before but hadn't paid much attention to it. After reading more about it my excitement for WASM has grown quite a bit. Being able to write interoperable code across a handlful of languages sounds like a really interesting paradigm shift for programming. 

My plan is to port my authentication service over to a serverless approach as an exercise to get more experience with both servelss and WASM.
