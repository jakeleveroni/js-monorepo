This is a project for 3D game development environment in the browser. It uses react-three-fiber which is a wrapper around three.js to run three.js in a react context. Honestly id just use three.js but im so used to the react project structure and ergonomics im having a hard time wanting to leave.

## Development

Install dependencies

```sh
bun install
```

Start the development server

```sh
bun ws -w game -s dev
```

The application should be running on `http://localhost:5173`.
