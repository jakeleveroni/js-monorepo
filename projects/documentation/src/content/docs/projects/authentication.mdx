## An Express Based JWT Server

This project started as I was interested in how JWT authentication worked from a backend sense. I had worked on various parts of the authentication flow before but never the actual server that manages generating, assigning, and validating JWTs. It was the perfect opportunity to learn.

## Development

Install any dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

Start the application

```sh
bun ws -w auth -s dev
```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3010`

## Testing

The test suite is setup so that on startup, the database connection the server expects is replaced with an in memory database via [pg-mem](https://github.com/oguimbal/pg-mem). This allows us to test end-to-end from request to database. It also ensures the latest DB schema is applied to the in memory database so you can be confident in your tests. 

API tests are validated with [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest). To run the test suite simple run:

```sh
bun ws -auth -s test
```

## Workspace Commands

Workspace specific commands

### gen-error-code

This command generates error codes. It takes in an optional prefix and returns a list of error codes based on that prefix. Essentially just `prefix-incrementing_number`. It can be handy for backfilling API error responses to provide unique ID's to each possible error the api can return.

**Example Usage**

```sh
bun ws -w auth -s gen-error-code -- -p EXPREFIX -a 2

# Outputs: EXPREFIX-0001, EXPREFIX-0002
```

The idea behind this was to provide a unique ID for every error response the authentication server sends to make it easy to pinpoint where an error you see in a response from this server originated from.


### gen-secret

This is a simple command that takes an input and returns a hex encoded sha512 has of the provided input. This is used to generate secrets that we can use to hash the users passwords with. Keep in mind in a deployed env you NEED TO KEEP THE SECRETS SAFE i.e. NOT COMMITTED.

**Example Usage**

```sh
bun ws -w auth -s gen-secret -- -i "a super secret input phrase"

# Outputs: 
#Secret generated:
#
#  6a91110047a55ebd9045f945de32e5511ec15c0cf27b9ac6c22ab19cf8dee5c677e05deabe72dfa7e45e9d2fe1c39356b012c66235ed1fbe6b05b6580314fdea
#
# dont lose your input value or you wont be able to re-generate it.
```

## Next Steps

- I want to standup a valkey cache layer for this server to use
  - once that is stood up i want to move the JTI introspection into valkey instead of a rudimentary in-memory object.
- Audit for other common security vulnerabilities in JWT servers and remedy
- Build out a much more thorough test suite
