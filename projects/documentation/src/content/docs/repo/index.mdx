title: Monorepo Overview
description: Documentation on the monorepo's tooling
template: doc
---

This is a Javscript based monorepo that holds a bunch of my projects. I will likely not finish many of these projects but its primarily a playground for me to tinker and learn in. Its a my Javascript Tool bench if you will.

This monorepo is built using Bun and as i have worked in it i have built out more cli tooling for working in a monorepo via bun. I hope to expand on this as i use it more and the needs arise to hopefully build a robust monorepo developer environment based on what i think is the next evolution of javascript runtimes.

## Working in the Monorepo

When working in the monorepo its important to understand some of the tooling that is currently built out for your convenience.

## Project Structure

This repo is broken down into a handful of top level folders:

```
js-monorepo/
├── projects/
├── node-projects/
├── modules/
├── infra/
└── scripts/
```

### projects

This is where the Bun based applications are defined. This and the modules are the primary focuses of the monorepo tooling. Each applciation will have a directory here

### node-project

This is where any Node.js based applications are defined. I try to avoid this as I want to focus on Bun, but until it has 100$ node compat some things just dont work and WASM is one of them.

### modules

This is where the modules that are shared across applciations are defined. If you want to define libraries this is where you would do it.

### infra

This is where I define utility methods that monorepo scripts might rely on.

### scripts

This is where i define cli commands I run via Bun. Sometimes I wire them up to package.json scripts other times i run them directly via `bun run {script-name}`. And other times still I call them via other scripts with `Bun.spawn`. 

See the `scripts` option in the side navigation for a more in-depth look at the individual scripts exposed thus far.

**NOTE: app & modules in the `/projects` and `/modules` directories can define their own scripts by placing the scripts in their respective app's `{app-name}/scripts` folder. i.e. `/my-app/scripts/custom-start.ts`.**
