# Command Description

This command checks all the workspaces as defined by the root `package.json`'s `workspaces` array. It uses Bun Glob pattern matching to determine which directories are workspaces and then runs a `git diff` on each of them to derive an array of affected workspaces.

This will be used much more later on when we start building out automation functionality for generating tasks to execute in CI.

This command is aliased in the root `package.json` as `affected`.
