# Command Description

This command enables rudimentary functionality similar to `yarn -workspaces ...`. It is used to execute scripts on specified "workspaces" (folders under the `/projects` & `/modules` directories).

In the root package.json there is a script declared called `ws` (workspaces for short). This aliases `bun run scripts/workspaces.ts` to `bun ws`. This script accepts a few parameters `workspace`, `script`, an `help`.

This cli command respects passthrough parameters delimeted by `--` (double hyphen). Anything following the space after `--` will be passed to the underlying script called.

      <td>Name of a workspace under the package.json's defined workspaces. Can be a workspace specific package.json script or a script in the workspace's scripts/ directory.</td>

## Example Usage

Running a single workspace
```sh
bun ws --workspace foo --script build
```

Running a command against multiple workspaces
```sh
bun ws -w foo -w bar -s build
```

Running a command with passthrough parameters. Here the `--mode` param is propagated to the `build` command defined in the specified workspaces. This script will check the workspaces's scripts directory first. Then the workspaces `package.json` scripts. If nothing is found that matches the script name it will fail.
```sh
bun ws -w foo -w bar -s build -- --mode production
```

Manually call the script
```sh
bun run scripts/workspaces.ts -w foo -w bar -s build
```
